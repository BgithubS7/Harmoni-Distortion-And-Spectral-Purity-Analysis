# Harmonic Distortion and Spectral Purity Analysis using FieldFox N9917B

This project uses the Keysight FieldFox N9917B to analyze the harmonic distortion and spectral purity of its internal CW signal generator. By looping the RF output back to the input, we measure the power of the fundamental tone and its harmonics at frequencies like 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz using the built-in spectrum analyzer.

## Highlights
- No external components required ‚Äî fully self-contained loopback test
- Quantifies Total Harmonic Distortion (THD)
- Demonstrates RF signal integrity analysis and test instrumentation skills
- Relevant to wireless hardware validation and compliance testing and processes 

## Repo Structure
- `data/`: Exported spectrum data (.csv)
- `plots/`: Spectrum and THD visualizations
- `scripts/`: Python analysis code
- `hardware_setup/`: Loopback photos
- `report/`: Final write-up (PDF)

## Hardware Setup Explanation

This project uses a **self-contained loopback configuration** to evaluate the harmonic distortion and spectral purity of the internal CW signal source on the **Keysight FieldFox N9917B**.

### üß∞ Equipment List
| Component              | Purpose                                                               |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **FieldFox N9917B**    | Generates and analyzes RF signals (CW source + spectrum analyzer)     |
| **SMA RF cable**       | Connects RF output to input for loopback measurement                  |
| **10‚Äì20 dB attenuator** *(optional )* | Prevents overloading the spectrum analyzer input |
| **USB flash drive**    | Used to save screenshots and measurement data                         |
